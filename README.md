# Codename
An Obsidian plugin for generating random codenames.

## Why?
One of the hardest problems in anything is naming.  Using Obsidian allows you to very quickly get organized, provided you don't get hung up on naming things.  This plugin aims to provide a very simple way to generate a name for anything, and once you have a name, you can correlate everyhting together, and rename it later to something more ... relevant.

This is especially handy for generating project names when you don't know what you're building yet, or for keeping a project a secret from prying eyes.

## Who?
This plugin is for anyone who needs a way to generate random codenames.  That could literally be anyone.


## What?
### Using the plugin:
Once installed and enabled, this plugin provides a new command in the Command Pallet `Codename: Insert Codename`, which will generate and insert a new codename wherever the cursor happens to be in the editor.
